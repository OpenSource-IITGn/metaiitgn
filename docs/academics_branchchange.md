# Branch Change

IIT Gandhinagar allows eligible BTech students to change their branch based on academic performance and institute norms. The policy is periodically updated; the latest norms (as of March 2025) are detailed below.

---

## Branch Change Policy

### For Students Admitted from AY 2025-26

- **Timing:** Branch change applications are accepted only once, at the end of the first semester and before the start of the second semester.
- **Eligibility:** Students must have a **CPI (Cumulative Performance Index) of 6.50 or higher** and **no fail grades or backlogs** to be eligible.
    - **Fail grades/backlogs** include:
        - First semester BTech courses dropped before the end of the semester
        - Prescribed courses not registered for
        - Fail grades in zero-credit courses (e.g., Physical Education)
        - Fail grades in Pass/Fail courses (e.g., General Education)
- **CPI Calculation:** Only prescribed courses for the first semester are considered for CPI calculation. Any additional courses taken beyond the prescribed curriculum are not counted.
- **Order of Merit:** Applications are processed in order of merit determined by CPI.
- **Seat Restrictions:**
    - The strength of any branch after branch change **must not exceed 110%** of its sanctioned strength for that year.
    - The strength of any branch after branch change **must not fall below 50%** of its sanctioned strength for that year.
- **Unrestricted Change:** Students with a **CPI of 9.50 or higher** may change branch without being subject to the above seat restrictions.
- **Frequency:** Branch change is permitted only once, after the first semester.

#### Example Scenarios

- **Example 1:** If the sanctioned strength of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) is 40, after branch change, the total number of students in CSE cannot exceed 44 (10% above 40). If 3 students from other branches wish to move to CSE, only 4 can be accommodated in total, including any existing overflows.
- **Example 2:** If Mechanical Engineering (ME) has a sanctioned strength of 40, at least 20 students must remain in ME after branch change (50% of 40). If 25 students wish to leave ME, only 20 can actually do so; the rest will not be permitted to change out.
- **Example 3:** If a student with a CPI of 9.60 applies for a branch change, they can move to any branch of their choice, even if the destination branch exceeds 110% of its sanctioned strength or the source branch falls below 50%, as these restrictions do not apply to students with CPI ≥ 9.50.
- **Example 4:** If a student dropped a prescribed first semester course before the semester ended, or did not register for a required course, or failed a zero-credit/Pass-Fail course, they are **not eligible** for branch change.

---

### For Students Admitted Before AY 2025-26

- **Unrestricted Change:** Students with a **CPI of 9.50 or higher** can change their branch without any seat restrictions.
- **General Eligibility:** Other students may apply if they have a **CPI of 6.50 or higher** and **no fail grades or backlogs** (including dropped/unregistered/zero-credit/Pass-Fail courses as above).
- **Order of Merit:** Applications are processed in order of merit determined by CPI.
- **Seat Restrictions:**
    - The strength of the destination branch must not exceed **110%** of its sanctioned strength.
    - The strength of the source branch must not fall below **50%** of its sanctioned strength.
- **Timing:** Branch change is permitted only once, at the beginning of the second academic year (after the second semester).

#### Example Scenarios

- **Example 1:** If Electrical Engineering (EE) has a sanctioned strength of 50, after branch change, the number of students in EE cannot exceed 55. If 7 students from other branches want to move to EE, only 5 can be accommodated.
- **Example 2:** If Chemical Engineering (ChE) has a sanctioned strength of 40, at least 20 students must remain in ChE after branch change. If 25 students want to leave, only 20 can do so.
- **Example 3:** If a student with a CPI of 9.60 applies for a branch change, they can move to any branch of their choice, regardless of the above seat restrictions.
- **Example 4:** If a student dropped a prescribed first-year course before the semester ended, or did not register for a required course, or failed a zero-credit/Pass-Fail course, they are **not eligible** for branch change.

## Additional Guidelines

- **Fail Grades/Backlogs:** For the purpose of branch change, fail grades/backlogs include:
    - Courses dropped before the end of the semester
    - Prescribed courses not registered for
    - Fail grades in zero-credit courses (e.g., Physical Education)
    - Fail grades in Pass/Fail courses (e.g., General Education)
- **Frequency:** Branch change is permitted only once per student, as per the above timelines.
- **No Mid-Year Applications:** No applications for branch change will be accepted during subsequent academic years.
- **Reconsideration:** If another student transfers to a branch, requests may be reconsidered in order of merit, provided seat restrictions are not violated.

# Degree Change

## BTech to MTech (Sliding Mode)

Students pursuing BTech at IIT Gandhinagar (joined in 2013 or later) can apply for conversion to the BTech-MTech dual degree programme (sliding mode) after completing four semesters, but no later than the end of six semesters.

- **Minimum CPI:** 6.0 out of 10 at the time of application.
- **Eligible Disciplines:** Students may apply to any discipline with a regular MTech programme, provided they meet the discipline’s eligibility criteria (announced in advance).
- **Selection Process:** Recommendations for conversion are made by a selection committee set up by the discipline in which the student wishes to pursue their MTech.
- **Additional Requirements:** If the MTech discipline is different from the BTech discipline, additional courses may be required as specified by the second discipline.
- **Credit Requirements:**  
  - At least 72 credits for the MTech component (24 through courses, 32 through thesis units), in addition to BTech requirements.
  - For students admitted from 2022-23, up to two open electives from the BTech programme may count towards MTech coursework if they qualify.
- **Graduation:** Both BTech and MTech degrees are awarded after completing all requirements for both.
- **CPI Calculation:** A single CPI is maintained until completion of both degrees; two separate CPIs (BTech and MTech) are shown in the final transcript.
- **Honours/Minors:** Students may also pursue Honours in the same discipline and/or Minors in other disciplines as part of their BTech degree.
- **Pass/Fail Conversion:** Allowed for only two courses during the entire dual degree period.
- **Other Norms:** All other academic norms (e.g., course substitution) apply separately for BTech and MTech requirements.
- **Exit Option:** Students may request to opt out of the dual degree at any point with valid reasons (subject to approval); they will then be treated as BTech students.
- **Conversion to BTech:** If a student does not maintain a CPI above 6.0 or secures more than two U (or F) grades in MTech thesis units, they will be converted to the BTech programme (sliding mode only).

## BTech-MTech Dual Degree (Direct Admission Mode)

> **Note:** Direct admission to BTech-MTech dual degree is discontinued from AY 2025-26.

- **Branch/Programme Change:** Students admitted through direct admission may request a one-time change of programme/branch at the beginning of the second year, governed by the same branch change policies as BTech programmes.
    - The direct admission BTech-MTech dual degree is considered equivalent to a branch of a regular BTech programme for this purpose.
    - *Example:* A student in BTech-MTech Dual Degree (CSE) may switch to BTech (Chemical Engineering), BTech (CSE), or BTech-MTech Dual Degree (EE), and vice versa.
- **Programme Change within Discipline:** After the branch change round, students in a direct admission dual degree may request a change of programme within the discipline before the second year, based on merit, provided the number of students in the dual degree does not fall below 50% of its sanctioned strength.
    - Merit at the end of the first year is considered (no fail grades/backlogs).
    - Change from BTech-MTech dual degree to regular BTech is allowed only once at the beginning of the second year.
