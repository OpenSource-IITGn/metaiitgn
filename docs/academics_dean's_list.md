# Dean's List

The Dean's List recognizes those students who achieve a certain level of academic excellence in an academic term. Such a student receives a personalized letter of appreciation from the Dean (Academic), to honour and recognize their excellent academic performance.

## Eligibility criteria

### The senate approved the creation of an Academic Citation List in addition to the existing Dean's List for BTech students. The approved criteria for Dean’s List and Academic Citation is as follows.

* The selection of students for the Dean's List and Academic Citation shall be based on one's relative performance among the students from the same discipline while also meeting some minimum eligibility criteria outlined later.

* B.Tech students (including all variants such as BTech-MTech, BTech-MSc, BTech dual major etc) in their 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th semesters for a batch will be considered for Dean's List and Academic Citation.

##### Top 5% of enrolled students in each discipline based on SPI shall be placed on the Dean's List, provided the following eligibility criteria are met:

1. The SPI should be equal to or greater than 8.0
2. The minimum credit load (excluding the thesis units) should be 20
3. There should not be an F grade in any credit courses in the concerned semester
4. Not placed on any probation – academic or disciplinary

##

* Top 15% of enrolled students in each discipline based on SPI shall be put on the Academic Citation list provided they meet the same eligibility criteria as of the Dean’s List. A student who gets into both the lists will be placed only in the Dean’s List.
* Students in all variants of BTech programmes including BTech-MTech, BTech-MSc, BTech dual major etc. shall be considered for the Dean's List/Academic Citation in their parent discipline only. Such students will be put in a single cohort for these lists.
* CPI will be used as a tie breaker.
* If the number of students in a discipline for a specific batch is such that 15% of the student strength is less than 3, Rank 1 shall be placed on the Dean's List, and Rank 2 & Rank 3 shall be placed in the Academic Citation List subject to meeting the above eligibility criteria.
* The students on the Dean's List can be felicitated at institute-level events such as Republic Day or Independence Day celebrations.
