**A.) Grades and Grade Points** - At the end of the semester or a term, the evaluation of a student is done on the basis of a letter grade in each of his/her course by the Instructor-in-Charge. The grades are submitted to the Academic Section within the prescribed limit of **96 hours** of the end of the Examination III/Last evaluation of the course.

The letter grades and their numerical equivalents are:

|Letter<br>Grades  |**A+**|**A**|**A-**|**B**|**B-**|**C**|**C-**|**D**|**E**|**F**|
|---------------|--|--|--|-|--|-|--|-|-|-|
|Grade<br>Points|11|10|9|8|7|6|5|4|2|0|



Few insights into the assignment of these grades:

  1. In addition to these, there are letter grades **I** and **P**, which stand for **Incomplete** and **Pass**, respectively. The credits earned for course with grade **P** are not counted in the SPI/CPI evaluation.

  2. The **A+ (11/10)** is given as mark of excellence.


  3. In case the SPI/CPI calculation shows a grade point value of more than 10, it is restricted to 10 points.

  4. The letter grades **E** and **F** are both considered as *Fail Grades*; a student will have to repeat/replace the course in which he/she gets fail grade. If someone fails in the Foundation Programme, he/she can replace it by a course in Humanities (a General Education course in case of students admitted from 2022-23). The **E** would be removed from the grading system from Semester 1, 2023-24.

  5. The units of **thesis/projects** will be graded using the letter codes **S(Satisfactory)**, **U(Unsatisfactory)**. For students admitted from Semester 1, 2023-24, thesis units will be graded using the letter grades A, B, C, and F; *where A, B, C are pass grades and F is a fail grade.* Thesis grades are not counted towards SPI/CPI calculation.

<br><br>
**B.) The Incomplete Grade (I)** - A student can receive an **I** (Incomplete) grade in a course if they have a *valid reason for missing a small part of the course* but have *done well in all other aspects*. It's important to note that an 'I' grade is not given just because a student missed an exam. The instructor must convert the 'I' grade into a regular letter grade and inform the Academic Section by a specific deadline mentioned in the academic calendar. If a student still has an 'I' grade after this deadline, it will automatically be changed to an 'F' grade.
<br><br>
**C.) Project Grades** - The grades for projects must be submitted by the deadline specified for grade submission. An 'I' grade will not be given simply because a student didn't complete their project. However, an 'I' grade may be given if there are valid medical reasons.
<br><br>
**D.) Thesis Grades** - Each semester, a student earns 4 credits for each thesis unit they are registered in. At the end of the semester, the student's thesis supervisor will evaluate their progress in the thesis work. If the work is satisfactory, the student will receive an 'S' grade for that unit. If the work is unsatisfactory, they will receive a 'U' grade. This means that a student registered for 4 units can have one of the following combinations: SSSS, SSSU, SSUU, SUUU, or UUUU.

If a thesis unit receives a 'U' grade, it will not count towards the required thesis credits for completion. For students admitted starting from Semester 1, 2023-24; thesis units will be graded using letter grades A, B, C, and F. Grades A, B, and C are considered passing grades, while F is a failing grade. However, these grades for thesis units will not be used to calculate the student's SPI/CPI.
<br><br>
**E.) Change of an Already Awarded Grade** - Unless a request made by the Instructor-in-Charge of the course is approved by the Chairmain of the Senate, the awarded letter grade cannot be changed. Any such request must be made within six weeks of the start of the next semester.
<br><br>
**F.) Semester Performance Index (SPI)** - The Semester Performance Index (SPI) is a
weighted average of the grade points earned by a student in all the courses credited and
describes his/her academic performance in a semester.

Suppose a student is awarded grades G1, G2, G3, and G4 in four courses and the respective credits are c1, c2, c3, and c4, then the SPI is calculated as:


<!-- $$ SPI = \frac{c1G1 + c2G2 + c3G3 + c4G4}{c1 + c2 + c3 + c4} $$ -->

<br><br>
**G.) Cumulative Performance Index (CPI)** - The CPI is indicative of the overall academic performance of a student in all the courses registered. In case of a **P** grade, the credits of that course are dropped from calculation of CPI. Considering all the courses (say, N), the CPI is calculated as:

<!-- $$
CPI = \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^{N} c_iG_i}{\sum_{i = 1}^{N}c_i}
$$ -->
![CPI Formula](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?%5C%5C%20CPI%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B%5Csum_%7Bi%20%3D%201%7D%5E%7BN%7D%20c_iG_i%7D%7B%5Csum_%7Bi%20%3D%201%7D%5E%7BN%7Dc_i%7D)

Note that, whenever a student is permitted to substitute or repeat a course, a new letter grade replaces the older one while computing the CPI, but, both the grades appear in his/her Grade Report.
<br><br>
**H.) Grade Report** - A copy of the Grade Report is issued to each student at the end of the
semester. A duplicate copy, if required, can be obtained on payment of the prescribed
fee.
<br><br>
**I.) Witholding of Grades** - The grades of a student may be withheld if he/she has not paid
his/her dues, or if there is a case of indiscipline pending against him/her, or for any other
reason.m
