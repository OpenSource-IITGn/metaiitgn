# Honour Code

Honour Code is a set of values which is expected to be followed by IIT Gandhinagar students. It is not a set of rules dictated by the Institute. Itâ€™s a way of life, created, governed and respected by the students. The Honour Code is based on the simple premise that, people will do the right thing under all circumstances. The students affirm to uphold the highest principles of honesty and integrity in all their endeavors and foster an atmosphere of mutual respect. The students will not take undue advantage of another individual of the IITGN community, be personally and academically honest and treat others with respect and courtesy and neither give nor receive unauthorized aid explicitly, but be responsible and speak out against any unjust practice.

 *We, the students of IIT Gandhinagar, affirm that we will uphold the highest principles of honesty and integrity in all our endeavors and foster an atmosphere of mutual respect. We will not take undue advantage of another individual of the IITGN community. We will be personally and academically honest and treat others with respect and courtesy. We will neither give nor receive unauthorized aid explicitly or implicitly for any academic activities. We will not only pledge our honesty to the Institute and its community, but we will also be responsible and speak out against any unjust practices among us.*
