# Anti-Ragging Policy

Ragging includes any disorderly conduct, whether by words spoken or written, or by an act which has the effect of teasing, treating or handling with rudeness any student, indulging in rowdy or undisciplined activities which cause or are likely to cause annoyance, hardship or psychological harm or to raise fear or apprehension thereof in a fresher or a junior student and which has the effect of causing or generating a sense of shame or embarrassment so as to adversely affect the psyche of a fresher or a junior student. The Institute has zero tolerance for any act amounting to ragging inside or outside the Institute and considers it to be a violation of human rights. If a student feels that he/she has been a victim of ragging, they are requested to approach the Instituteâ€™s Anti-Ragging Committee or Dean (Student Affairs) immediately.
